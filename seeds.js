                The game is surrounded by a community that holds a financial stake in Axie via the game’s two currencies, which they can use to influence its development.

There are also several buttons around it so you can create custom shortcuts and macros, plus Razer's iconic RGB lighting makes the whole package aesthetically pleasing. This is one of the best discounts we've tracked, coming in at just $10 more than the lowest we've seen for the mouse.
      You can also snag the standard Razer Basilisk X Hyperspeed for $35 ($25 off)—it might be a better deal if you don't care about tons of onboard buttons or the absolute lowest latency.

    "content": `Today (October 13), New World went down at 11AM BST for maintenance that will – according to Amazon Game Studios – take an estimated five hours. This means that while  New World servers are currently offline, they should be back online at around 4PM BST. New World servers are down so that Amazon Game Studios can implement ‘another swathe of bug fixes’ and further setup for upcoming server transfers.
    According to the patch notes, the studio is ‘working tirelessly on ensuring everyone can find a world to call their long-term home with the character transfer feature’. The New World update alters the rate of faction influence gained over time, in order to slow down the speed at which territories can be thrown into a state of conflict. Part of this is to account for a bug ‘where the increase was multiplied much faster than intended over time’.

'Very Classic WoW vibe with OSRS skills. Level 29 as of 71 hours. Lots of drama in chat because the game is somewhat competitive, but PvP can be really fun.
    Really cool map and sound design. Some graphical/audio bugs every now and then. For the vanilla version of Amazon’s flagship MMO, this is a good game. But it could be much better in time.' New World isn’t entirely out of the woods yet, though. Some of the more negative reviews focus on what some players feel is a lack of story, a world lacking in excitement and soul, and a tedious levelling experience. 'New World has some interesting ideas but overall feels shallow and soulless (yet somehow I’m still playing)', one reviewer concludes.

The coaching change was announced during the second day of the VCT NA Last Chance Qualifiers (LCQ), which Envy already bypassed through their direct qualification to VCT Champions.
    Chet replaces coach Michael 'Mikes' Hockom, who parted ways with Envy after apparent frustrations about his contract status. During the team’s Berlin run, Mikes’ passport delays forced him to coach the team remotely from the US. While Envy’s VCT campaign is still up and running, the same can’t be said for TSM. Under Chet’s coaching, TSM’s VALORANT squad topped the VCT NA Stage 3 Challengers 2 after a comfortable 3-1 victory over FaZe Clan. This secured the team a spot in the NA Stage 3 Challengers Playoffs, only to have their run cut short. TSM crashed out of the tournament in the quarterfinals stage, suffering consecutive 1-2 defeats in the upper and lower brackets to Envy and Rise, respectively.`,
